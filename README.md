# CubeSolver

I got a puzzle cube in September of 2019 that I couldn't solve. Seeing some friends solve it in minutes made me mad, so here's a solver for it. Appparently these are called snake cubes.

You can see the solver in action [here](https://headmerchant.github.io/SnakeCubeSolver/).

To run locally, clone the repository and run `npm install`. Compile `solver.ts` with `npx webpack` and serve via a local server.
